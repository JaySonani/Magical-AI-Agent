Once you are complete, please put up the code in a **private** repository and add your contact at Magical as a collaborator (use their email to invite them).

Time limit: this take-home is due 72hrs after you receive it.

### Task

Create a working agentic loop that will fill out an example healthcare workflow. Here is the SOP (standard operating procedure) for the workflow:

1. Navigate to https://magical-medical-form.netlify.app/
2. Fill out the form with:
   1. First Name: John
   2. Last Name: Doe
   3. Date of birth: 1990-01-01
   4. Medical ID: 91927885
3. Click 'Submit'

### Bonus Points

In this challenge there are a few bonus points, that'll help supercharge the agent.

1. Complete the 2nd and 3rd sections of the form. You will need to:
   1. Fill out dropdowns
   2. Scroll to, and open the appropriate sections
2. Add the ability to run the workflow via an API call
3. Add the ability to pass in variables for the prompt
   1. Think a dynamic "First Name" and "Last Name"
4. Make it so that this workflow can be run automatically on a schedule, every 5 minutes in this case.
